        <h1>Displaying Distributions</h1>
        <h3>A <span class="important">distribution</span> is simply how a bunch of data falls onto a graph.</h3>
        <h3>The <span class="important">level of distribution</span> simply refers to the measures of central tendency, which are often the mean, median, and mode.</h3>
        <h3>The <span class="important">spread</span> of a distribution refers to range, or more specific ranges such as interquartile.</h3>
        <h3>The <span class="important">shape</span> of data refers to what type of graph it is, such as bar, line, or the worst graph in the world, the pie chart.</h3>
        <h3><span class="important">Outliers</span> in a distribution are easily distinguished as they are visibly separate from the rest of the data. They can have a strong effect on the mean of the data.</h3>
